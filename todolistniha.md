- i vector ang dataset

- write and execute test cases
- add account registration + auth, allow multi-profiles
- auto capitalize food entries
- if an entry is updated, it displays "Food entry" instead of showing the entry name from before

- found an error where if i try to log for previous days, they just end up being logged on the current day
- fix day list scrolling behaviour. if for example. 5 is the current day, if i scroll all the way to the left, then scroll again, the current display should be 27 28 29 30 31. if from 31, i scroll to the right, then the list should be 1 2 3 4 5 again, not 28 29 30 31 1
